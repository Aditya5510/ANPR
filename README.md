An AI-powered ANPR system that detects and recognizes license plates from images using OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras. It employs Haar Cascade for plate detection, contour analysis for segmentation, and a CNN-based model for character recognition.
ðŸ“Œ Features

âœ… Detects license plates using Haar Cascade
âœ… Segments characters with contour analysis
âœ… Recognizes characters using a CNN model
âœ… Image preprocessing (grayscale, thresholding, erosion/dilation)
